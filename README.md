# sundown-boulevard

Sundown Boulevard is a restaurant booking system, made for a coding challenge at [Dwarf](https://dwarf.dk/)

## Features:

- Get a random dish from The Meal DB
- Select drinks from the Punk API
- Select a date within 16-23 on weekdays
- Add amount of people
- Confirm booking and save it to LocalStorage
- Retrieve order by email

## Possible future additions:

- Make responsive
- Format date on recipe to be more readable
- Add some nicer error messages
- Add loading states
- More animations, like on Drinks and amountOfPeople switcher

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
